### Finding the Factorial of a number in C++ and Python


> _This project is meant to compare the difference in the paradigms used in C++ and Python._
> 
> _It uses the 'python Factorial.py' command to compile the Python file and the 'clang++ Factorial.cpp'
> command to compile the C++ file._


### Differences in the Paradigms Used by Python and C++:
> While Python and C++ both share some of the same paradigms, namely both Procedural and Object-Oriented
> Programming Paradigms, they also differ in the same way.
> 
> Their differences in Programming Paradigms include:
