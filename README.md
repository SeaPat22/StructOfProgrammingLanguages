# StructOfProgrammingLanguages - Project
### Finding the Factorial of a number in C and Python


> _This project is meant to compare the difference in the paradigms used in C and Python._
> 
> _It uses the 'python Factorial.py' command to compile the Python file and the 'gcc Factorial.c'
> command to compile the C file and then the './a.out' command to run the compiled code._


### Differences in the Paradigms Used by Python and C:
> While Python and C both share some of the same paradigms, namely the Procedural Programming Paradigm,
> they also differ in the same way.
> 
> Their differences in Programming Paradigms include Python having an Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm
> and C not being an object-oriented language at all.  This is shown in the 'Factorial.py' file with the 
> declaration of the Factorial class.  Due to this, C must rely on procedure calls because
> it is a Procedural Programming Paradigm language with no object-oriented capabilities.
> C is also an Imperative Programming language and this is shown by the data type being added to the 
> variables at declaration in the 'Factorial.c' file while this is not needed in Python.
